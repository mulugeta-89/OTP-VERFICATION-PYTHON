# OTP Verification Project
Welcome to the OTP Verification Project! This project was created as a task for my internship at Sync Interns. The goal of the project is to generate a One-Time Password (OTP) and verify it using a GUI built with Python Tkinter.

# Description
The OTP Verification Project is a Python GUI application that allows users to generate a one-time password and verify it using the same interface. The application uses Python's random and string modules to generate a random six-digit OTP. The GUI was built using Python Tkinter.

The OTP Verification Project has the following features:

Generate OTP: Users can generate a six-digit OTP by clicking the "Generate OTP" button.
Verify OTP: Users can enter the OTP they received and click the "Verify OTP" button to check if it matches the generated OTP.
Error handling: The application handles errors such as invalid OTP and empty fields.
